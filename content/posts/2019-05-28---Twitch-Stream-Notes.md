## What we did

### Show and Tell (15 minutes)

- [SparkFun Apollo Board](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15170)
- MOAR Neopixels for Emotion Mesh!

### Emotion Mesh! Edge ML & IoT Project (2 hours, 45 minutes)

#### Recap

- Talk about what we did last time (Configure UART between Coral and Argon, mostly)
- Review what I did last week off-stream
    1. Wired up arcade buttons and LEDs 
    2. Added a state machine to controller firmware
    3. Button presses on box mapped to actions on the Coral
    4. Trained and tuned a local emotion detection model for the Coral

#### This time
            
- Solder and assemble the controller board on an Adafruit Perma-proto board
- Mount everything into the button box (incl. standoffs)
- Wire up the emotion detection prediction script to the capture/demo flow

#### Stretch (probably next time)

- Start working on UI for hiding the streaming display and showing the modified images on the main screen
- Figure out how I am going to capture stats for captures

## What we learned

- Brandon needs to make sure he has the right hardware before a stream next time! ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
