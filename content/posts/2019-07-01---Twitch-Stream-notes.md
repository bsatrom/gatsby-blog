## What we did

### IoT Show and Tell

- AdaBox #012!
- Particle Boron SOM Eval Board
- Byte Barista MicroPython Badge
- Various BLE Sensors (Temp, OBD-II, Generic Tag)

### Emotion Mesh! Edge ML & IoT Project

#### Recap of NDC Oslo and EmotionMesh Demo

- NDC Oslo Recap. Videos should be posted in the next week!
- ML & IoT Talk and Demos Recap
- Live #EmotionMesh Demo

#### This time
            
- Let's add some BLE goodness to the EmotionMesh network!
- Add the Stats-Viewer Project and configure for my device.
- Advertise the current network state via BLE from the EmotionMesh controller
- Read the current network state via BLE on another device and display the state on a TFT.
## What we learned

- BLE is great when it works, but Brandon needs to figure out how to pass strings in byte arrays!
