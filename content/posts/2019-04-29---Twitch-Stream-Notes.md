- Time: 12-3 pm Central
- VOD 

## What we did

### Show and Tell (5 minutes)

- Raspberry Pi Zero W
- Oboo Smart Clock

### Continuing the Wall of Things (~1 hour, 55 min)

- Review what we did last time

- Things I want to do in the bot today:
  1. Fix the sub/resub `context` error
  2. Allow the breathe color to be configurable
  3. Handling an invalid list of colors
  4. Add `!clay` command and trigger disco mode
  5. Create a `!pulse` command to check my heart rate, on demand

- Things I want to do in firmware today:
  1. Debug multiple calls to breathe
  2. Allow the breathe color to be configurable
  3. Consider ways to sync up the breathe animation
  4. Disco mode

## What we learned / Ideas for next time

- I need to implement some linting and testing of the bot
- @dot_commie had decreed the second emote will be a brick emote brando92Brick (cyan brick thx @theMichaelJolley)
- I BRICKED A DEVICE... maybe?
- We walked through various ways to try to recover and reflash devices
- It's time to work on the hand project...
