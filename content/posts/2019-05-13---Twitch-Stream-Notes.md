### Show and Tell (15 minutes)

- Adafruit buttons and switches!
- [My thoughts on ioT @ Build](https://dev.to/bsatrom/three-things-i-learned-about-microsoft-s-iot-vision-at-build-e5h)
- Streaming schedule change! Mondays from 12-3 pm Central. No Thursday streams for now.

### Edge ML & IoT Project

- NEW Project: Emotion Mesh! Using the Google Coral and Particle Mesh to do Edge-based face-tracking and emotion detection
- Walk through the Coral Object Detection and face-tracking source code
- Figure out how to capture an image from the webcam
- UART Setup between Coral and Argon
- Set-up a project in Azure IoT Central for Emotion Mesh

## What we learned / Ideas for next time

- [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/tutorial/) is an amazing tool for command-line JSON visualization and parsing
- Python built-in docs are your friend: https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/methods/built-in/sorted
