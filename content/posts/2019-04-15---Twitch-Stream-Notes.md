## What we did

### Show and Tell (15 minutes)

- [SnapOnAir PortaPi](https://www.tindie.com/products/electronictrik/snaponair-raspberry-pi-zero-pcb/)!
- New Grove Sensors
- [32x64 LED Panel](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2277)
- [A mysterious silicon hand](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01LZWYF2I/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1)

### Continuing the Wall of Things (1 hour, 45 min.)

- Review what we did last time

- Things I want to do in the bot today:
  1. Add handling for invalid colors
  2. Detect cheers, follows and subs and trigger disco mode 

- Things I want to do in firmware today:
   1. Increase delay on breathe mode
   2. Implement disco mode in firmware

## What we learned / Ideas for next time

- bscolaro suggested naming whatever we build with the severed hand "high buddy"
- Handling on invalid list of colors
- Good ideas from bscolaro and theMichaelJolley on synching up the breathe animation on the strips
- Add WoT Wall to my BRB scene
