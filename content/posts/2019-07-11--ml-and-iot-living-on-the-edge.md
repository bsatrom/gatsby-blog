In June, I had the privilege of traveling to Oslo, Norway for the [NDC Oslo](https://ndcoslo.com) conference. In addition to taking place in one of my favorite countries, NDC Oslo is one of the best developer events I've attended, drawing over 2,400 attendees and 200 amazing speakers from around the world.

For the 2019 iteration of the conference, I presented a talk titled "ML & the IoT: Living on the Edge." The [slides](https://speakerdeck.com/brandonsatrom/ml-and-the-iot-living-on-the-edge) and a [recording of the talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SYjR2D4p0c&list=PL03Lrmd9CiGe9QtFC8LRRqknzpKgcrWpe&index=134) are embedded below.

And, as I am wont to do, I did much of the work to build the demos for this talk during my [weekly Twitch streams](https://twitch.tv/brandonsatrom). If you want to see the nitty-gritty of how this project came together over several weeks, check out the stream notes and replay videos, below.
