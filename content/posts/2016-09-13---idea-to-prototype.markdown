For the last several months, I've been working on a project I'm calling the "Brew Buddy." It's a simple electronics setup that helps manage the homebrewing process from first boil to wort cooldown. The rig contains a [Particle Photon](https://www.particle.io/products/hardware/photon-wifi-dev-kit), a [2.2in TFT from Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1480) and, in the latest iteration, a [Type-K Thermocouple](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13715) and [breakout board](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13266) from SparkFun. The thermocouple monitors wort temperature throughout the process, and the TFT display shows the current temp, current phase, total time and a rudimentary "dot chart" of the last several temperature readings.

I designed the PCB for the Brew Buddy in [Eagle](https://cadsoft.io/) and milled it on the [Othermill](https://othermachine.co/), an amazing desktop CNC mill.

Brew Buddy is still very much a work in progress, but I wanted to share a video I put together (with my GoPro and the help of [Adobe Premiere Pro](http://www.adobe.com/products/premiere.html)) that covers some of my latest design changes, milling on the Othermill and final soldering and assembly. Check it out below, feel free to throw a comment here or over at YouTube and, if you like it, subscribe to [my YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAS6I-NFh25eBhwMX2KCxqQ).

Next up for the Brew Buddy, I plan to design and 3D print a custom enclosure. Stay tuned here for a follow-up video on that process, as well as some additional info about the mobile app I'm creating to control the setup.
